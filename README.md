##  Tools Used

- **Database**: MySQL (compatible with PostgreSQL or SQLite)
- **SQL Commands**: SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, JOINs, Subqueries, Views, Indexes
- **IDE**: MySQL Workbench / DB Browser / pgAdmin (any SQL environment)
- **Document Editor**: Microsoft Word (for screenshots)

---

## Concepts Applied

- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`
- `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`
- Subqueries with `AVG`
- Aggregate functions: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`
- View creation using `CREATE VIEW`
- Query optimization using `CREATE INDEX`

---

## Queries Performed

1. **Retrieve customers with last names starting with 'J'**
2. **Count of customers grouped by address**
3. **INNER JOIN between customer and payment tables**
4. **RIGHT JOIN to retrieve all payments with/without matching customers**
5. **LEFT JOIN to retrieve all payments and associated customer info**
6. **Select payments above the average amount**
7. **Total and average payment amount per customer**
8. **Create and describe a view for customer contact info**
9. **Create an index on last name for faster filtering**
